## Consumer Load Balancing
```sh
$> ruby consumer_loadbalancing/consumer1.rb
$> ruby consumer_loadbalancing/consumer2.rb
```
The above scripts do not have prefetch enabled, therefore if we run the following script, 10 times
```sh
$> ruby consumer_loadbalancing/publisher.rb
```

Each of the consumer1 and 2 scripts will handle 5 messages each. Even though the time to handle message by each
consumer is different. Consumer2 takes longer to process.

To naturally load balance consumers enable prefetch. Run the following scripts and repeat publisher run 10 times.
```sh
$> ruby consumer_loadbalancing/prefetch_consumer1.rb
$> ruby consumer_loadbalancing/prefetch_consumer2.rb
```
