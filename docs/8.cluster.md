## Creating RabbitMQ cluster

* First start up two additional ec2 instances
* Install RabbitMQ
* From the main node copy /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie to other nodes
* Switch of the management console
```sh
$> rabbitmq-plugins disable rabbitmq_management
```
* To get cluster status
```sh
$> rabbitmqctl cluster_status
```
* On both the nodes run the command
```sh
$> service rabbitmq-server restart
$> rabbitmqctl stop_app
$> rabbitmqctl join_cluster rabbit@<hostname of master/node1>
$> rabbitmqctl start_app
```
* To ensure that the management console shows reports from other nodes install management agent
```sh
$> rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management_agent
```

* Create que on a new node
```sh
$> ./rabbitmqadmin -V mov -u jerry -p jerry declare queue name=ga_que node=rabbit@ip-172-31-42-228
```

* Run the script to send a message
```sh
$> ruby cluster/publisher.rb
```

* Run the script to recieve messages. Edit the host to add any of the three node ips
```sh
$> ruby cluster/consumer.rb
```

* Run the cluster consumer script to receive messages from any machine on the cluster
```sh
$> ruby cluster/cluster_consumer.rb
```

* Stop Rabbitmq in any of the cluster nodes. The broker will terminate connection with the consumer.
* Consumer can be restarted to receive messages.
* You can apply logic in the code, to reconnect. (while in the middle of a connection)
* Its usually better to put a loadbalancer in front, like HAProxy.

### High Availability
* A cluster in itself cannot guarantee high availability. To test this, shutdown rabbitmq in the instance where the que was created.
* The producer or the consumer will not be able to send or receive messages. 



* Removing nodes from a cluster
First stop the app on the node you want to remove
```sh
$> rabbitmqctl stop_app
```

On the master node remove the node from cluster
```sh
$> rabbitmqctl forget_cluster_node rabbit@ip-172-31-44-229
```
